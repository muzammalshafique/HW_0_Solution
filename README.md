# **Text Normalization and Frequency Analysis Tool**

## **Overview**
This Python script processes text files for normalization, token frequency analysis, and visualization. It offers various preprocessing options, such as stemming, lemmatization, removing stopwords, and filtering tokens based on custom rules. Additionally, it can visualize the frequency distribution of the top tokens using bar or line graphs.

## **Features**
- Tokenize text and preprocess with options:
  - Convert text to lowercase.
  - Remove stopwords.
  - Apply stemming or lemmatization.
  - Remove URLs or custom patterns (e.g., numbers).
  - Filter tokens by minimum length.
- Count word frequencies and display the most/least frequent tokens.
- Visualize token frequency distribution with customizable graph types.
